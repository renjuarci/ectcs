# GREENWEB-FINANCIAL-MANAGEMENT-APPLICATION
This is a small software for financial institution and management. It was developed using web technologies like PHP, MySQL, JavaScript (with jQuery), and CSS. It is very easy to use and adaptable.

This application has been designed in such a way that is easy to setup even for a non-developer. It is very easy to install.

Secondly create a folder and name it whatever you want, only remeber that the name will constitute the url for accessing the application from your browser. Upload all the files and folders into the folder you created and thats all.

Open the link from the web browser and the setup will begin.

It will prompt you to enter database host. username, password, name and to select the type of installation you want (either fresh or with the test data). I personally will suggest fresh installtion selection.

host: localhost
Database user: root /
Database password: '' (empty password).
Database name: whatever you like
Installation type: fresh

After this, if you selected fresh installation, it will prompt you to enter admin username, password and confirm password.

You login and enjoy the endless opportunities of this application.

Please note that with this application you can do 
- Customer management
- Share account management
- Savings account management
- Loan management
- Employee management
- Reporting
- Accounting

Play around the application to see possibilities.

I developed this application when i worked with Greenweb Systems and they permitted me to put it here just for a short duration in order for any prospective employer to access my work.

This application is fully based on web technology, it requires a PHP-capable webserver and a MySQL database. For testing purposes, using XAMPP is recommended
